#### About the Game

This will be a double sided game/tool, you can use it as a tool to do your tarot reading and see the meaning of the cards and all the other "taroty" things, and you can also play the hidden game inside of it. But first you have to figure out how to access the game before playing it. (That's all i can say for now)
